# About

This project is an experiment in human/AI interactions. The user is able to choose between several different AI therapists, each with differing personalities. They can then interact with the AI therapist via a chat. 

The information shared during each session is encrypted and stored, so the AI therapist remembers key information about the user. This would theoretically allow the AI therapist to remeber information from previous sessions in order to make progress, much like a real therapist.

It was built using React Native and a Python/Flask backend.

It uses the OpenAI api in order to generate responses. THis required a large amount of prompt engineering.
